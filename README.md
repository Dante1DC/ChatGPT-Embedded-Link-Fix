This is a super simple Firefox and Chrome extension that fixes an issue on chat.openai.com, where sometimes, if ChatGPT is providing a list of urls, it makes them unclickable, and thus, inaccessible. This extension fixes this incredibly small and minute problem. I've only had this problem in Firefox, so the extension has only been built and tested for this browser. This extension is also listed on [Mozilla's extension storefront](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-embedded-link-fix/) if you wanna check it out there. This is an incredibly niche problem, that very few people problably have, but now, there's a fix for it.
